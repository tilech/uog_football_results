# Football Results Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing football match results from the German Bundesliga using R and Stan. The goal is to build statistical models that capture team performance and match outcomes over time.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of football results
- Statistical modeling with R and Stan
- Exploratory analysis and visualization of team performance trends

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tilech/uog_football_results.git
   ```
2. Open the `uog_football_results.Rproj` file in RStudio.

## Usage

After opening the project in RStudio, you can run the modeling script via the main file in R directory.
Various parameters like the prediction season or time decay can be set in the beginning.
One can choose to run individual models or grid searches for different parameters.
The outcomes are given as lists including the prediction results, plots and evaluation metrics.
